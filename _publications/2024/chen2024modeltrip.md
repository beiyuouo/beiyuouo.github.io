  Federated Learning has emerged as a revolutionary innovation in the evolving landscape of global healthcare, fostering collaboration among institutions and facilitating collaborative data analysis. As practical applications continue to proliferate, numerous federations have formed in different regions. The optimization and sustainable development of federation-pretrained models have emerged as new challenges. These challenges primarily encompass privacy, population shift and data dependency, which may lead to severe consequences such as the leakage of sensitive information within models and training samples, unfair model performance and resource burdens. To tackle these issues, we propose FairFusion, a cross-federation model fusion approach that enhances privacy and fairness. FairFusion operates across federations within a Model Trip paradigm, integrating knowledge from diverse federations to continually enhance model performance. Through federated model fusion, multi-objective quantification and optimization, FairFusion obtains trustworthy solutions that excel in utility, privacy and fairness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three public real-world healthcare datasets. The results demonstrate that FairFusion achieves outstanding model fusion performance in terms of utility and fairness across various model structures and subgroups with sensitive attributes while guaranteeing model privacy.
