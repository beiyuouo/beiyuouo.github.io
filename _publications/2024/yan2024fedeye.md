  Federated learning (FL) enables training machine learning models on decentralized medical data while preserving privacy. Despite growing research on FL algorithms and systems, building real-world FL applications requires extensive expertise, posing barriers for medical researchers. FedEYE, an end-to-end FL platform tailored for ophthalmologists without programming skills, is developed here to easily create federated projects on tasks like image classification. The platform provides rich capabilities, scalability, flexible deployment, and separation of concerns. With user-friendly interfaces and comprehension of underlying mechanisms, FedEYE strives to democratize FL for ophthalmology.
