    Federated learning has emerged as a powerful technique for training robust models while preserving data privacy and security. However, real-world applications, especially in domains like healthcare, often face challenges due to non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-iid) data across different institutions. Additionally, the heterogeneity of data and the absence of a trusted central server further hinder collaborative efforts among medical institutions. Our paper introduces a novel federated learning approach called FedTAM, which incorporates cyclic model transfer and feature attention-based multi-teacher knowledge distillation. FedTAM is designed to tailor personalized models for individual clients within a decentralized federated learning setting, where data distribution is non-iid. Notably, this method enables student clients to selectively acquire the most pertinent and valuable knowledge from teacher clients through feature attention mechanism while filtering out irrelevant information. We conduct extensive experiments across five benchmark healthcare datasets and one public image classification dataset with feature shifts. Our results conclusively demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable accuracy improvements when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. This affirms the potential of FedTAM to significantly enhance federated learning performance, especially in challenging real-world contexts like healthcare.
