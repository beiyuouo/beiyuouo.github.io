  Federated Learning (FL) creates an ecosystem for multiple agents to collaborate on building models with data privacy consideration. The method for contribution measurement of each agent in the FL system is critical for fair credits allocation but few are proposed. In this paper, we develop a real-time contribution measurement method FedCM that is simple but powerful. The method defines the impact of each agent, comprehensively considers the current round and the previous round to obtain the contribution rate of each agent with attention aggregation. Moreover, FedCM updates contribution every round, which enable it to perform in real-time. Real-time is not considered by the existing approaches, but it is critical for FL systems to allocate computing power, communication resources, etc. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, the experimental results show that FedCM is more sensitive to data quantity and data quality under the premise of real-time. Furthermore, we developed federated learning open-source software based on FedCM. The software has been applied to identify COVID-19 based on medical images.
